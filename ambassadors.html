        <h2>MEET THE STUDENT AMBASSADORS</h2>
        <p>
            This year, we are bringing 9 student ambassadors who are current Pitt students to China. Selected from a highly competitive process, Pitt ambassadors reflect a diverse array of majors, involvement, and backgrounds, and will serve as your guides during your transition to Pitt, Pittsburgh, and the United States. Each Ambassador will be assigned a small group of mentees in both Beijing and Shanghai and will meet with their group while in China and throughout the fall semester when everyone is in Pittsburgh. The Student Ambassadors will help you connect with resources, services, and involvement opportunities both at Pitt and within the City of Pittsburgh. The Student Ambassadors are excited to meet you in June and help you feel a part of the Pitt community!
