            <p>
                I am very excited to join the Pitt to You Ambassador Program! As a third-year student, I am currently majoring in Environmental Studies and Sociology. I am working towards my certificate in Global Studies and I have developed many interests throughout my time at Pitt. I am incredibly passionate about connecting people with the outdoors and I believe that any day spent outside is a day well spent. In my free time, I can be found running around the ‘Burgh on the Three Rivers Trail or chomping on some homemade chocolate chip cookies. I love to explore new places and create new experiences with my family and friends.

                Hello, my name is Zach Passalacqua and I am currently a junior here at the University of Pittsburgh. I am very passionate about my studies and am currently pursuing degrees in marketing, psychology, and business information systems. Over the summer, I studied abroad in Sydney, Australia and worked as an intern for a marketing agency. Studying abroad was by far my greatest college experience. I also love my job as a resident assistant; I am currently in my second year as an RA. When I’m just relaxing, I really enjoy going to the gym, hanging out with friends, and watching Netflix. I am looking forward for the Pitt to You Program!

            <p>
                My name is Eryn McCormick and I am a Junior Industrial Engineering student with a minor in Economics. I chose to attend Pitt because of the notoriety of the academic curriculum and the endless opportunities to get involved in. This year, I am currently serving as a Resident Assistant (RA) in Tower B Gold and am the VP of Outreach for the Society of Women Engineers (SWE). In SWE, I oversee the planning and execution of all outreach programs that introduce young boys and girls to the principles of engineering. I am also immersed in experiential learning as a Co-op at FedEx Ground. I serve as the International Co-op within FedEx Ground’s International Trade Support & Engineering department (ITSE), where I use data analysis and communication skills to improve domestic and foreign processes. In my free time, I love to travel and serve in the community. My favorite service organization I am involved in is the Appalachia Work Camp, where I travel to Booneville, KY to construct homes and additions for the impoverished over the course of ten days. I am really excited for the Pitt to You Ambassador program and am looking forward to developing connections with the incoming international students!
